<!-- Namespaces are a mechanism in PHP that provides a way to organize code and avoid naming conflicts between different parts of your application. They create a hierarchical structure, similar to folders in a file system, allowing you to group related classes, functions, and constants under a common namespace.

Benefits of Namespaces

Avoid Naming Conflicts: Namespaces prevent conflicts between classes, functions, and constants with the same name but different purposes.
Improve Code Organization: Namespaces make your code more structured and easier to understand, especially for large projects.
Enhance Code Reusability: You can reuse code from different libraries or projects without worrying about naming collisions.
Improve Code Maintainability: Namespaces make it easier to manage and update your codebase as it grows. -->
